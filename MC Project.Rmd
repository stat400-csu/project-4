## Project Overview

### Introduction

This project replicates and extends the Monte Carlo simulation from Defaye et al. (2025) on Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device (CIED) longevity. The original study introduced a Power Consumption Index (PCI) model to standardize battery life predictions across different pacemaker models and manufacturers.

### Research Goals
1. Replicate the PCI model and Monte Carlo simulation methodology

2. Extend the model by incorporating greater physiological variability in lead impedance

3. Compare device longevity predictions under base and extended scenarios

### Power Consumption Index Model

**Model Definition**

The core PCI model from the original study is defined as:

**PCI** = t × I / C

Where:

**t** = Time in minutes

**I** = Total current drain (µA)

**C** = Battery capacity (Ah)
